## About
A Dashboard to report weather conditions of the Southern Rockies of Canada

## TODO
- Add snow forecasts (have them switch with rain forecasts at appropriate time)
- Find a better way to add cities than changing code
- Fix white border on site to be background colour
- Get ready to deploy
- Figure out how often it calls the api, report it somehow
- Read config from ENV, api key cache TTL, log level etc, some might have defaults.
- Add logging and log levels
- DATA only refreshews on initial load (add interval: https://dash.plotly.com/live-updates)
- Highlight the weekends in the graph somehow
